# What's this?
This is the crazy idea of leveraging SSH and containers to create text based APIs

What if instead of users, what used to represent them now they represents methods?

SSH provides us with out of the box security (authentication, encryption) and Docker
enables us to isolate these APIs and to use any programming language to implement
each method of these APIs.

This is not and does not pretend to be a serious thing, it's just a fun crazy thing.

# Usage
This project is meant to be used by using it's docker image and adding a user per
API method, which will have the implementation script or binary as shell for that
user. Take a look at the examples for a better understanding.
